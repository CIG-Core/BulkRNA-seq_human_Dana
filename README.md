## Primary Exploratory Analysis: `lasso_chunk.Rmd`

When dealing with a large number of features (over 16,000 genes) and a relatively small sample size (n=12), traditional lasso regression can yield unreliable results due to increased risk of overfitting and spurious correlations. To mitigate this, we implemented a chunked approach, dividing the feature space into smaller subsets of 1000 genes each.

**Workflow Overview:**
1. Sorted the expression matrix from high variance to low variance.
2. Ran lasso logistic regression separately on each chunk.
3. Compiled selected genes from each chunk.
4. Conducted a final lasso regression to build the model.

While the heatmap generated from this analysis revealed more signals compared to traditional differential expression analysis, it's important to note potential limitations. Fragmenting the data into chunks may introduce spurious correlations and hinder capturing meaningful signals, particularly if correlations between chunks are disrupted.

## Further Analysis: `Lasso_WGCNA_16_Logistic.Rmd` and `Lasso_WGCNA_16_Gaussian_linear.Rmd`

We used WGCNA to Reduce the ratio of genes/samples by finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes (similar expression patterns). WGCNA is an unsupervised method and based on soft threshold, we used soft threshold = 16 and 18 for the following analysis (Note: 16 seems to work better than 18).

**Workflow Overview:**
1. Subset the expression matrix based on modules selected from WGCNA (modules are more significantly correlated with Pre vs. Post-treatment)
2. Ran lasso regression separately on modules.
3. Compiled selected genes from each module.
4. Conducted a final lasso regression to build the model.

**Note:**
We used both Logistic and Gaussian_linear models to evaluate the selected genes. The results were shown to ensure the consistency of our analysis.
